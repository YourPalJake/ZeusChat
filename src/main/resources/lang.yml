##RECOMENDATIONS

##GUIDE
#By default I will process the message trough PlaceholderAPI by passing it the sender etc
#but if a message has an annotation containing: target, that means that the player specified by the sender
#in the command will be passed trough PlaceholderAPI so if you have %player_name% as placeholder instead of
#it showing the name of the sender it will show the name of the target
